                <h2>Greetings</h2>
                <p>
                    Do not fret, I am not dead yet. Instead of a bio, here is my self-written obituary. It expresses my me-ness far more accurately because it expresses me as a thinking feeling being, less as that which I have done.
                </p><p class="nl">
                    Almost everybody I met asked me the exact same question&mdash;sometimes straight away, always inevitably. Odd, I know. Of the infinite number of questions one may ask, always the exact same question. My answer? Six eight. 
                </p><p>
                    I hope death came with a bang or a whimper. If a bang, I hope I was deep in love or in adventure or in play or in work. If a whimper, then I would have met death as a river meets the sea, once raging and chaotic, now slow, spread out, calm, dispersed completely. I hope death did not find me doing something boring like crossing the road. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Loves</h3>
                <p>
                    I loved to <i>learn</i>. Learning became one of my true loves when I was about 14, year eight. In my science class store room, probably packing away bunsen burners, beakers, and pouring out some pungent liquid, I chanced a look at a sciency magazine on the bench and leafed through it. A quote from a scientist caught my eye, saying something like 'If I had a superpower it would be curiosity'. I was shocked. Why, I thought, would somebody choose curiosity as her superpower when she could fly, breath underwater, time travel. Then of course the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon took effect and curiosity showed up everywhere. My mind became acquainted with it and soon enough was addicted. Before this I often encountered things that I did not know and let them float by. After, I began paying attention to the unknown floating things, learning about them. I quickly found myself in a maelstrom of things to know, tugged and tossed and turned about by shiny new bits of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. Amidst all this tumbling I hope I created a few beautiful, useful things and ideas. 
                </p><p>
                    I loved to <i>adventure</i>. I loved it because my parents loved it. I would hike up mountains while still breastfeeding (carried, of course); surf a bodyboard when I was about as tall as my leg is long now; pee in my snow suit when learning to snowboard because going to the loo was a waste of time; refuse to use a snorkel while diving (don't remember why). After these first five years of my life, the adventures did not stop. At 19, I travelled to South America with 'Hola', a surfboard, and plenty of naivety. There I really got to know myself. I discovered a confidence; found out how I behave in a <a href="#">near death experience</a>; met wonderful people; ate exotic foods; drank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terremoto_(beverage)" target="_blank">eye-watering drinks</a>; <a href="#">surfed huge waves</a>; danced (vertically and horizontally); lived. Just as the world opened itself to me so too opened my mind, heart, and loins.
